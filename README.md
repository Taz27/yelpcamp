_My NodeJS Project_

This is an interactive web application where users can view and share information about their favourite campgrounds around the world. Users are also able to view and add comments.

I have used **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap** at the front-end and **NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB** at the back-end along with various amazing libraries including ***Mongoose*** (for Data-Modeling), ***PassportJS*** (for user Authentication & Authorization), ***Connect-flash*** (for showing flash Messages to user), ***MomentJS*** (for formatting date and time) and ***EJS*** view engine (for rendering dynamic content).

I have also followed the **RESTful API** routing convention for making CRUD operations **(GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP requests)**.
